Miniforge3 is available in /apps/miniforge/23.3.1-1
 to create and manage your own python environment. Setup conda using:

  $ source /apps/miniforge/23.3.1-1/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

 or

  $ eval "$(/apps/miniforge/23.3.1-1/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"

 or load the miniforge module

  $ module load miniforge/23.3.1-1

 You will need to create your own environments thereafter.
 e.g. $ conda create --name myPythonInstall
      $ conda activate myPythonInstall

 You can add the bioconda channel with
  $ conda config --add channels bioconda

 Default disk quota for scratch: 1.5TB/user
 Max no of files: 150,000/user

 Default disk quota for /home/users: 200GB/user
 Max no of files: 150,000/user

 To check your current consumption and assigned quota on the pluto login node:
 =============================================================================
 
 For home:
  $ mmlsquota -u $USER --block-size auto fs-hpc:fss-hpc-home

 For scratch:
  $ mmlsquota -u $USER --block-size auto fs-hpc:fss-hpc-scratch

 * your blocks consumption is listed under "blocks" column
 * your files (or inodes) consumption is listed under "files" column
 * your quota is listed under the respective "limit" column


For example,

 for home:
 [$USER@hpc-login01 ~]$ mmlsquota -u $USER --block-size auto fs-hpc:fss-hpc-home
                         Block Limits                                               |     File Limits
 Filesystem Fileset    type         blocks      quota      limit   in_doubt    grace |    files   quota    limit in_doubt    grace  Remarks

 * the user above consumed 747M out of 200G for block and 754 out of 150000
   for files

 for scratch:
 [$USER@hpc-login01 ~]$ mmlsquota -u $USER --block-size auto fs-hpc:fss-hpc-scratch
                         Block Limits                                               |     File Limits
 Filesystem Fileset    type         blocks      quota      limit   in_doubt    grace |    files   quota    limit in_doubt    grace  Remarks

 * the user above consumed 256K out of 1.465T for block and 8 out of 150000
   for files

 You can run the script /apps/how-to/check-storage-use-and-quota.sh
 to do a quick check on usage.

 Queue info
 ===========

Refer to /apps/how-to/queue.info for job scheduler queue info​
 and /apps/how-to/interacting-with-slurm.txt for basic job scheduler commands.
 
 SLURM job script examples can also be found in /apps/how-to/sample-scripts

 For PBS users, see /apps/how-to/pbs-slurm-translation

 General information for new HPC user
 ====================================
 * Please do not run any jobs on the login node(head node). 
   Any unauthorized process on the login node will be terminated immediately.
 * Please submit your jobs through the job schedulers on each HPC system. 
   Sample job submission scripts are located in /apps/how-to/ on each system.
 * Please use $HOME/scratch to run all jobs and after each job is completed, 
   please copy your important result data to $HOME/DATA or transfer to your
   own storage, e.g. your workstation.
 * Users are strongly advised not to store important data in $SCRATCH, as it
   has no backup.
 * For longer term storage, please store your files in $HOME/DATA.
   This is a common SOD filesystem mounted on all HPC login nodes. This $DATA
   has no backup for itself.
   (NOTE: this space is visible only from the login nodes and not from the
    compute nodes. So users are NOT TO run jobs from DATA.
